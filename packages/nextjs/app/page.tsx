              conditions. During the campaign of soyabeans it is expected to rain between <b>500</b> and <b>800</b> mm
              of water. If this condition is not fulfilled, you can collect 10x the fee you paid.

              ðŸ”… Select the region where you produce your soyabeans

              ðŸ”… Pay the Fee
              <br />
              ðŸ”… When the campaign for your region ends, and if the rain was bad you can collect the insurance.

              <br />
              ðŸ”… To avoid wait the dates and get bored :P, there is a &quot;testing&quot; function (called
              setCurrentDate) which you can use to change the date and play accordingly. <br />
              ðŸ”… You have to pass the date in unix format and this is only for testing purposes.
